# Job Scraper

Automated job search pipeline that scrapes public ATS APIs, filters for relevant roles, enriches with H1B sponsorship data, and outputs a sortable HTML dashboard + markdown digest.

## What it does

1. **Scrapes** 85+ companies across 6 ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Workable, Workday)
2. **Filters** through 41 role lanes using fuzzy title matching (rapidfuzz), location filtering (US-only), seniority checks, exclusion rules, and sponsorship keyword blacklisting
3. **Deduplicates** across platforms using SHA-256 keys in SQLite
4. **Enriches** with H1B sponsorship likelihood (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) via employer fuzzy matching
5. **Outputs** a dark-themed HTML dashboard with client-side sorting/filtering, plus a markdown digest

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.11+)
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create your personal config from the templates (these are gitignored)
cp config/applicant_profile.example.yml config/applicant_profile.yml
cp config/profile.example.yml           config/profile.yml
cp config/master_resume.example.yml     config/master_resume.yml
# ...then edit each with your own details.

# Add your Anthropic API key (used for AI evaluation + resume tailoring)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env

# Import H1B employer data (curated list, ~105 companies)
python scripts/import_h1b.py

# Run the scraper
python -m src.main

# Run with options
python -m src.main --verbose                # Debug logging
python -m src.main --platform greenhouse    # Single platform only
python -m src.main --no-resumes             # Skip tailored resume PDFs
```

Open `output/latest.html` in a browser to view the dashboard.

## Dashboard control server (optional)

The dashboard is a static file, so its **Run Pipeline** and **Clean Applied
Resumes** buttons need a tiny local helper to act. Start it and leave it
running:

```bash
python scripts/control_server.py    # listens on http://localhost:8765
```

- **▶ Run Pipeline** — triggers a fresh scrape + AI evaluation (via the
  `com.devansh.jobscraper` launchd job, so it survives terminal exit).
- **🗑 Clean Applied Resumes** — deletes the tailored resume PDFs for any job
  you've marked applied (clicked its Apply link), keeping `output/resumes/`
  small. Also available standalone: `python -m src.resume.cleanup <job_id> ...`

The buttons show a connection indicator and degrade gracefully when the server
isn't running.

> **Note on privacy:** `config/applicant_profile.yml`, `config/profile.yml`,
> `config/master_resume.yml`, the SQLite DB, and everything under `output/`
> (which embeds your contact details) are gitignored. Only `.example.yml`
> templates are tracked.

## Data Sources

| Platform | API Type | Companies | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Greenhouse | REST GET | 43 | Best coverage, simplest API |
| Lever | REST GET | 2 | Mid-market tech |
| Ashby | REST GET | 10 | Growing among startups |
| SmartRecruiters | REST GET (paginated) | 2 | 10 req/sec limit |
| Workable | POST (token-paginated) | 0* | Built but no verified companies yet |
| Workday | POST (offset-paginated) | 9 | Big 4, F500, defense. Datacenters wd1-wd12 |

All APIs are free, public, and require no authentication.

## Configuration

All config is in `config/` and fully editable:

- **`companies.json`** — Seed companies by ATS platform. Each entry has a board token/slug and optional settings.
- **`role_lanes.json`** — 41 role lanes with canonical titles, required keywords, boost/negative keywords, and fuzzy match thresholds.
- **`settings.toml`** — Scraping delays, filter thresholds, H1B thresholds, output paths.
- **`sponsorship_blacklist.txt`** — Phrases in job descriptions that indicate no sponsorship (e.g., "unable to sponsor", "US citizens only").

### Adding a company

Add an entry to the appropriate platform array in `companies.json`:

```json
// Greenhouse
{"token": "airbnb"}

// Workday
{"tenant": "boozallen", "wd": "wd1", "site": "Careers"}
```

### Role lanes

Each lane in `role_lanes.json` has:
- `canonical_titles` — fuzzy-matched against job titles (token_set_ratio >= 75)
- `required_keywords` — must appear in title or first 500 chars of description
- `title_must_contain_any` (optional) — at least one must appear in the title itself
- `negative_keywords` — instant reject if found in title
- `boost_keywords` — raise match score above threshold

## Filter Pipeline

Jobs pass through 5 sequential filters:

1. **Date** — Posted within last 14 days (configurable)
2. **Location** — US-based or US-remote only
3. **Title match** — Fuzzy match against 41 role lanes, with seniority cap (rejects Staff/Principal/Director/VP+)
4. **Exclusion rules** — Rejects 7+ YOE requirements, senior-only roles, pure engineering/sales/clinical titles, internships
5. **Sponsorship blacklist** — Rejects if description contains "no sponsorship" etc.

## H1B Sponsorship Enrichment

Each matched job is enriched with an H1B sponsorship flag:

- **GREEN** — Employer filed 10+ H1B petitions (likely sponsors)
- **YELLOW** — Filed 1-9 petitions (possible sponsor)
- **RED** — No match found or 0 petitions

The curated list covers 105 major employers. For better coverage, import real USCIS/DOL data:

```bash
# USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub CSV
python scripts/import_h1b.py --file path/to/uscis_data.csv

# DOL OFLC LCA disclosure Excel
python scripts/import_h1b.py --file path/to/h1b_disclosure.xlsx
```

## Dashboard

The HTML dashboard (`output/latest.html`) features:
- Dark theme with sponsorship color-coded borders (green/yellow/red)
- Text search across all fields
- Dropdown filters: role lane, sponsorship flag, ATS platform
- Toggle: NEW jobs only, Rotational Programs only
- Sortable columns: company, title, lane, location, score, posted date
- Direct apply links

## Scheduling (macOS)

Run every 12 hours via cron:

```bash
# See the crontab line to add
./scripts/run_cron.sh --install

# Then add it:
crontab -e
# Paste the line (runs at 7 AM and 7 PM)
```

Logs go to `logs/scraper.log` (rotating, 5 MB x 10 files) and `logs/cron.log`.
